This is repo has all you need to build a Micropython game on the Pimoroni 2.8" display with a RPI Pico.

The idea is to use two existing files - balls_demo.py and button_text.py and combine these to make a Pico pong game.

the first goal is to understand how the balls demo.py works and the simple physics - then to combine both and make a single user pong game

# IDE
Good idea to use Thonny as the IDE - you can develop the code in that and then simply push to the device - its easy.

Thonny is free and can be found here with lots of info. And you can have Windows, Mac and Linix...

# Files

balls_demo.py shows a working app where balls are generated of a random size and then bounce around the four walls **cool!**
button_test.py shows you how you can capture the button events on the display device and take action.

There are more demo files here 

[Github source for display examples](https://github.com/pimoroni/pimoroni-pico/tree/5919c544287e3f8ff5a168264f4a70df78f50e79/micropython/examples/pico_display
)




It should look a bit like this - but for one player and uses two buttons - but you could make it for two players or just one player with two sides.
